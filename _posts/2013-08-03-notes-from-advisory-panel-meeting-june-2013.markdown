## Call Notes

* RP: +1 on this. Perfect world we will get a diff in github for review.

* ML: review of CC BY/BY-SA 4.0 for OD compliance

    * ACTION: HL to review with support from Andrew

* ML: we should reach out to Open Access + Open Education

    * RP: [ACTION: RP] I can ask Ross Mounce for Open Access

* RP: Open Definition [for Data / Content / Knowledge] seems good.

    * URL: [http://opendefinition.org/current/](http://opendefinition.org/current/)  (or latest)?

* Baden / Herb / Andrew: like breadth, simplicity of "Open Definition"

**DECISION: Open Definition by default.**

### 3. Disposition of OSSD (software service); see [http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/od-discuss/2013-June/000429.html](http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/od-discuss/2013-June/000429.html)

Mike: In light of all this, how about this plan for the current term:
* Continue with non-prominence of the OSSD on the site
* I'll prepare a minor update which just makes the page more presentable and send here for confirmation
* Participants may or may not wish to re-evaluate in the next term (eg a new chair in 2014, or some other definition of "term")

* RP: I'm happy for keeping but not highlighting atm

* RP: this is very important but we are not prioritizing atm

**DECISION: as per Mike's suggestions**

### 4. Outstanding review/notice of existing licenses

*UK OGLv2.0 with formal conformance request (live update on this if representative is on call) **[http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/od-discuss/2013-June/000424.htm*l](http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/od-discuss/2013-June/000424.html)

* RP: special appreciation to the process the National Archives has gone through on this

* ALL: this appears to be conformant and a great improvement on the previous version.

* **DECISION: this will go to a final vote on list once we have an absolutely final version. Advice right now is this is conformant.**

OGL Canada 2.0 with formal request [http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/od-discuss/2013-June/000425.html](http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/od-discuss/2013-June/000425.html) our feedback on an earlier draft at [http://opendefinition.org/2013/01/31/ogl-canada-proposal-feedback/](http://opendefinition.org/2013/01/31/ogl-canada-proposal-feedback/)

OGL Alberta 2.0 informally forwarded to list for comments [http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/od-discuss/2013-June/000415.html](http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/od-discuss/2013-June/000415.html)

Datenlizenz Deutschland; we sent feedback, Daniel can update on response if on call; see [http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/od-discuss/2013-March/000382.html](http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/od-discuss/2013-March/000382.html)

* **ACTION: [ML] Ping Daniel on list. Short summary of where we are at and can we publish the formal letter on the site news.**

City of Calgary Open Data License requested approval; discussion uncovered various problems; offer of more formal feedback not replied to [http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/od-discuss/2013-March/000374.html](http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/od-discuss/2013-March/000374.html) should we issue formal non-conformance notice?

* RP: Let's do it

* **ACTION: [HL] draft feedback post (markdown) and circulate to list for review**

### 5. Enhancing the submission and review process for licenses (including publication of results)

1. Add proliferation policy? [http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/od-discuss/2013-March/000373.html](http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/od-discuss/2013-March/000373.html)

* RP: strongly support this.

    * Explicitly: duplication is a reason to be resistant to reviewing conformance. 

        * Require a statement of motivation and difference when someone submits a license

    * If they press we would not refuse to to conformance

    * Specific category of "recommended" licenses (versus non-recommended)

* ML: cf opensource.org process

* ACTION: [ML] ping back to Kent on list

2. Other suggestions? Re publication, blog each accept/reject? Where?

New process

* Open an issue on github - [https://github.com/okfn/opendefinition/issues/new](https://github.com/okfn/opendefinition/issues/new)

* AND / OR Email the mailing list

    * If you really can't do either of these [opendefinition@okfn.org](mailto:opendefinition@okfn.org)

ACTION: [ML] update [http://opendefinition.org/licenses/process/](http://opendefinition.org/licenses/process/) as per this

	Also correct ref to open source definition

ACTION: Add a menu item for process to top menu. Add info at top of licenses page to link to process.

ACTION: [RP] - merge licenses repo - see [https://github.com/okfn/opendefinition/issues/7](https://github.com/okfn/opendefinition/issues/7)

ACTION: [RP] - plan for storing license texts - [https://github.com/okfn/opendefinition/issues/2](https://github.com/okfn/opendefinition/issues/2)

### 6. Does anyone want to work on licenses.opendefinition.org? See [http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/od-discuss/2013-June/000414.html](http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/od-discuss/2013-June/000414.html) for some random thoughts.

* Does anyone rely on the specific json published at
licenses.opendefinition.org? This may say something about how careful
to be.

A few people.

* is_okd_compliant and is_osi_compliant seem suboptimal names. OKD and
OSI aren't equivalents and "compliant" is vague; only "approved" would
be unambiguous. Can these be changed? Noticed via
[https://github.com/okfn/licenses/pull/12](https://github.com/okfn/licenses/pull/12)

AGREED: change to od_approved, osi_approved

ACTION: [ML+RP] check with users 

What does domain_content/data/software actually mean? Whatever the
license creator says? What informed wisdom agrees with? What people
do? What bodies have approved licenses? Noticed via
[https://github.com/okfn/licenses/pull/15](https://github.com/okfn/licenses/pull/15)



* If UK OGL is really intended to be used with software -- also via
[https://github.com/okfn/licenses/pull/15](https://github.com/okfn/licenses/pull/15) -- should we not be
recommending vetting by OSI? And/or depending on the meaning of
"domain" per above, maybe not marking it as a software license.

RP: They really should go via OSI then 

* How are versions expected to be reflected in json published at
licenses.opendefinition.org? Right now, they aren't. If were used in
building a chooser, as suggested on the site, what would choosing say

* What are the 3 "other" licenses in
[http://licenses.opendefinition.org/#all-licenses](http://licenses.opendefinition.org/#all-licenses) about? I can't figure
out why their compliance statuses are listed as they are.

* It seems a pity to not use the same short identifiers as
[https://spdx.org/licenses/](https://spdx.org/licenses/) ... and probably easier, to link to the
spdx page for each license.

RP: we could 

* I think it'd be grand to get opendefinition.org out of wordpress,
but not a pressing need. Anyone eager to do the work?

AGREED: this can wait.

* Could opendefinition.org be made unambiguously open again?
[https://github.com/okfn/opendefinition/issues/12](https://github.com/okfn/opendefinition/issues/12) :-/

7. Future AC membership; zero members in global south unacceptable. Suggestions for invitation?

* RP: Big +1 here

* Suggest various people to invite:

    * ACTION: [AS] World Bank person

    * data.gov / US Gov

    * Global south

        * data.gov.in

        * dados.gov.br (RP can intro)

        * any other orgs we can think of

        * Moldova: [AS] follow up to see if there is someone

        * Russia: [AS] 

    * Someone from UK National Archives

        * ACTION: [ML?] would you follow up with Jo Ellis

    * Research councils

ML: do we have a standard invite template?

A: nearly; what I used for most recent invites, will send to Andrew, Rufus
