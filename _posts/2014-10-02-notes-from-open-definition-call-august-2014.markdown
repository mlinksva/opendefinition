# Summary

### Communication Plan

communication plan on release of v2.0 - should send to the larger group? probably past the time for more discussion; should just give a heads up announcement to lists that this is happening

* draw up list of communities we want to notify, e.g. lists 
  * [Rufus] Open Knowledge
  * [tvol] CC lists (licenses, community, perhaps Open Policy Network)
  * [Luis] OSI
  * [Luis] Wikipedia/wikimedia
  * Open Data lists generally (e.g. open-government, OGP …)
  * [Rufus] Sunlight …
  * [??] Code for America
  * [tvol] LAPSI group, COMMUNIA
  * [Andrew?] World Bank
  * [Andrew] OPSI (Office Public Sector Info)
  * [Andrew?] LinkedIn Group(s)?
  * [Andrew] Future Gov Asia
  * [tvol] US Gov - OSTP / 18F (alert people from http://theunitedstates.io/licensing/) 
  * [Herb] Canada

### Announce(s)

Target: mid-Sept

Press Release [Herb + comms person]
* What is Open Definition - defining open in open data and open content
* v2.0 release - a milestone
* Why this matters

=> Actually PR and put on major blogs (e.g. Open Knowledge, Creative Commons, World Bank, …)

Appendix to PR
* Full announce
* No change for existing licenses

Detailed Announce for OD.org
* Goal
* Highlight changes
* Substantive changes (if any)
* No change to status of existing conformant licenses (which you can find at …)

Tweet: …

Email draft: 

### Approval Process
  * new status for conformance
  * looking at the license pages, approval process may not need much more work - some tweaks in questions.
  * licenses categories may need some more thought ( what does recommended actually mean and how does it relate to conformant ).
