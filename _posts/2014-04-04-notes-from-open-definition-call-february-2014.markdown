# Participants

* Andrew Stott
* Herb Lainchbury
* Rufus Pollock
* Mike Linksvayer

# Agenda

* goals for 2014

* review status of OD 2.0 as I feel we’ve not had sufficient time to discuss. we’ll have to try to keep this high level as it’s easy to get stuck in the details, which may be better discussed on the list.
* heading review - Herb
* intro - Mike
* do we know what’s missing / problematic areas / areas of agreement?
* next steps?
* I would like a discussion of ideas around non-proliferation of Licenses. Is the OD 2.0 expected to address this? Is there something else we can be doing (refine the process, make it available to publishers).
* do we want to continue to hold off on further license decisions until OD 2.0 is published? (BC and AB)

# Summary
