#### Comments 

Formerly used for a variety of material produced by UK central and local government.

Ancillary information from the Office of Public Sector Information can be found at:

  http://www.opsi.gov.uk/click-use/psi-licence-information/

Was also known as the core licence. Below we provide an excerpted version that includes the relevant sections.

This license is **[not open](http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/od-discuss/2012-December/000239.html)**. A probably incomplete list of clauses that make it so:

    6. How the Material may be reproduced

Does not grant permission to make any adaptation -- only translations
"by a competent translator" and conversion to formats for the vision
impaired. Not conformant with OKD #3.

Nearly every point in the Obligations section is problematic. Some are
odd for a public license (which this tries not to be), so I'll just
note the problematic ones that have been discussed recently regarding
UK OGL -- may-not-imply-endorsement and do-not-mislead:

    9.6 not use the Material for the principal purpose of advertising
or promoting a particular product or service, or in a way which could
imply that it is endorsed by a Department or a Public Sector
Organisation;

    9.7 not use the Material in any way that is likely to mislead others;

Of course the first part of 9.6 is also non-conformant with OKD#8.

## Excerpted License

### 4. The Material Covered by this Licence 

All Material may be reproduced under this Licence unless it is covered by paragraphs 1.2 and 5.

[snip]

### 6. How the Material may be reproduced 

In this Licence, to reproduce includes the following non-exclusive rights throughout the world: 

6.1 publishing the Material in any medium. This includes featuring the Material on websites which can be accessed via the internet or via an internal electronic network or on an Intranet; 

6.2 authorising users and subscribers, who use your electronic or digital products to access the Material by means of an End-User Licence. This will normally allow users and subscribers to download the Material to screen and printer for their own use. It does not otherwise allow you to authorise the reproduction of the Material; 

6.3 translating the Material from the English, Gaelic or Welsh language into other languages, provided that the translations are accurate and made by a competent translator; 

6.4 copying the Material for research or study;

6.5 converting to braille and other formats for people who are visually impaired;

6.6 copying by libraries.

### 7. Supply of Material 

7.1 In most cases you will be able to reproduce the Material from the Official Source as long as you are careful not to infringe the copyright of another party. You may reproduce the Material by whatever means you choose, including scanning, downloading from a Department or Public Sector Organisation's website or by rekeying. 

7.2 Details of the availability of Material will generally be contained on individual IAR records. You can find these by going to the central inforoute website www.opsi.gov.uk/iar/index.htm. The details will include the available formats, where the Material can be obtained and at what cost. If the Material is not readily available in a published form or if you want the Material to be supplied in a particular format, please contact the Department or the Public Sector Organisation explaining your requirements. The supply of Material in a particular format may involve a charge which will reflect any direct costs incurred by the originating Department(s) or Public Sector Organisation.

### 8. Charging Policy 

You will only be charged if there is a cost in supplying the Material to you or converting data from one format or medium into another (see paragraph 7.2). You can, therefore, reproduce the Material covered by this Licence direct from an Official Source without any charge.

### 9. Your Obligations 

You must: 

9.1 give accurate information on your Application and let us know if any of these details change; 

9.2 let us know if you want to cancel the Licence;

9.3 reproduce only Material which is covered by this Licence;

9.4 reproduce Material accurately from the current Official Source except where you make it clear that there is a more up to date version available; 

9.5 identify the source of the Material and feature the following copyright statement if you publish the Material: Reproduced under the terms of the Click-Use Licence. 

9.6 not use the Material for the principal purpose of advertising or promoting a particular product or service, or in a way which could imply that it is endorsed by a Department or a Public Sector Organisation; 

9.7 not use the Material in any way that is likely to mislead others;

9.8 not reproduce official imprints, departmental logos or badges, crests, medals and insignia of Her Majesty's Armed Forces. The Royal Arms may be reproduced only where they form an integral part of the Material and you are reproducing them in that context; 

9.9 not present your version of the Material as being the Official Source, for example by replicating the Official Source's style and appearance. 

9.10 allow us to inspect copies of any works which include the Material to check that you have kept to the terms of this Licence.
