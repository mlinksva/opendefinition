#### Comments 

The TCL existed only in draft form. The TCL is explicitly intended to address the protection of *data'' in line with the European notion of a [Database Right](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_right), as opposed to the Copyright protections afforded to ''creative works* by the majority of equivalent licenses.

#### How to apply 

Include a link to, or a full copy of the TCL in your work, and something like the following:

> Copyright (c)  [YEAR]  [YOUR NAME].
> This work is made available under the terms of the Talis Community License.
