#### Comments 

The GNU Free Documentation License is a copyleft license - which means that derivative works must be made available under the same or a similar license.

The creators of the license recommend that it is used "principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference."  Its most prominent user is Wikipedia.

The GFDL is **only** considered conformant if you

* don't use invariant Sections or cover texts
* don't include an "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications" section
* amend the DRM restriction (section 2) to be less broad (for example restricting to the requirement that the work is available without TPMs)

Please see for more information:
