Git repo for the <http://OpenDefinition.org/> website focused on the
the Open Definition (OD).

The current OD version is 2.0. Numerous translations are available
on the website. The ideal way to submit new translations is by adding
an `od/2.0/{language code}/index.markdown` file and sending a pull request on the `gh-pages` branch.

Many pages in the repository are related definitions and domain-specific
guides which are not highlighted in the site navigation; there's a
list at <http://opendefinition.org/participate/>. These are all still
of interest but in need of review and updating. Feel most welcome
to file issues, submit pull requests, and discuss on our [mailing
list](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/od-discuss).

Also see the related <http://licenses.opendefinition.org/> and its source
repository. Eventually these two sites and repositories will probably be
[merged](https://github.com/okfn/opendefinition/issues/7).
