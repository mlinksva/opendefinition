title: 'Canadian Sub-national Open Government Licenses'

OGL Canada 2.0 is listed on the main [licenses page](/licenses/). Many
provinces and municipalities have created non-reusable variants, which
unfortunately must each be analyzed separately. This page will list any
such licenses as they are approved as conforming to the Open Definition
by the Advisory Council.
