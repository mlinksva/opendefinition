   - Herb will again outline the changes and communicate these to the list; discussion settling down
   - need to get feedback from okfn-discuss and okfn-local
   - possibly get official @okfn twitter, etc. to tweet that this is happening to solicit any comments/feedback
   - [https://github.com/okfn/opendefinition/blob/master/source/open-definition-2.1-dev.markdown](https://github.com/okfn/opendefinition/blob/master/source/open-definition-2.1-dev.markdown)

 * IMF license for data reuse
   - already in place
   - is this solely a license or combo license/tos
   - do we need to assess licenses where there’s little chance to change and where we do not know the creator of the license
   - IMF is high profile
   - smaller orgs tend to look to larger orgs for leadership
   - let’s reach out to them?
   - ask on the list if anyone has a contact we can reach out to (Herb)

 * recommendations to Surrey
   - sent out last Friday
   - Herb to follow up
   - ideally Canadian federal govt will entertain a having a reusable license that sub-nationals can use as is done in the UK

 * licenses waiting for assessment
   - create a queue of licenses on github? 
   - possibly submit as issue to track
   - but volume is low and handling it ok on email list too
   - gpl v3 review, especially since CC BY-SA 4.0 one way compatibility process with gpl upcoming
   - license level National
   - what sorts of things should our recommended list

 * license approval process and communications check-in
   - okfn-discuss, okfn-local
   - possibly social media heads up from @okfn
   - also there’s the “updates” section of OD website; few posts there but could revive

 * open data and APIs
   - OD could try to keep up with this issue
   - open software services definition - http://opendefinition.org/ossd/ 
   - could have general discussion of challenges/problems; focus on government use case
   - Herb will follow-up after OD 2.1 is done
