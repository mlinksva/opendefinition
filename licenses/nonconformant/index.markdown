### Project Gutenberg License

#### Full text

<http://www.gutenberg.org/license>

#### Comments

Used on Gutenberg's ebooks of public domain texts. It is non-open because it restricts commercial use. Note that the license **only** applies if you continue to use the Gutenberg name - if you remove the licensing information and any reference to Project Gutenberg then the resulting text is open.

## Discontinued Licenses

### Creative Commons Developing Nations License

#### Full text

<http://creativecommons.org/licenses/devnations/2.0/>

#### Comments

The license has been discontinued. Creative Commons developing nations license does not support OD 1.1#7 "No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups".

### Open Publication License

#### Full text

<http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/>

#### Comments

Discontinued in favour of Creative Commons. In late 2004 the site was overhauled and turned into a portal to open academic content. In August 2007, David Wiley, the author of opencontent lauched the [draft Open Education License](http://www.opencontent.org/blog/archives/355).

License is **not** conformant if either options A or B are added to the main body of the license. Option A prohibits 'substantive modification' and option B prohibits commercial use of printed copies.


### UK PSI (Public Sector Information) Click-Use Licence

#### Full text

<http://www.opsi.gov.uk/click-use/system/licenceterms/CCWPS03-00.pdf>

#### Comments

[Formerly](http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/od-discuss/2012-December/000245.html) used for a variety of material produced by UK central and local government.

Ancillary information from the Office of Public Sector Information can be found at:

<http://www.opsi.gov.uk/click-use/psi-licence-information/>

Was also known as the core licence. Below we provide an excerpted version that includes the relevant sections.

This license is **[not open](http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/od-discuss/2012-December/000239.html)**. A probably incomplete list of clauses that make it so:

    6. How the Material may be reproduced

Does not grant permission to make any adaptation -- only translations
"by a competent translator" and conversion to formats for the vision
impaired. Not conformant with OD 1.1#3.

Nearly every point in the Obligations section is problematic. Some are
odd for a public license (which this tries not to be), so I'll just
note the problematic ones that have been discussed recently regarding
UK OGL -- may-not-imply-endorsement and do-not-mislead:

    9.6 not use the Material for the principal purpose of advertising
or promoting a particular product or service, or in a way which could
imply that it is endorsed by a Department or a Public Sector
Organisation;

    9.7 not use the Material in any way that is likely to mislead others;

Of course the first part of 9.6 is also non-conformant with OD 1.1#8.
