## About

The Advisory Council was created in the Autumn of 2007 as the body formally responsible for maintaining and developing the Definitions and associated material found on this site. Its mission is to take forward the 'Open Definition' work for the general benefit of the open knowledge community. In addition, it has specific responsibility for deciding on license conformance with the Definition.

It should be emphasized that it is the hope, and intention, that overall development continue in the same community based and collaborative manner used until now with the Council's role being to provide oversight, guidance and input into this process, not to replace it.

See [participate](/participate) for information on joining the Council and contributing to Open Definition work in other ways.
