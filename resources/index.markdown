## Form Emails to Enquire About the Status of a Work

Email templates for enquiries regarding the status (open or not) of work found on the internet.

Word-wrapped at column 72 for convenience.

### Looks Like it is Supposed to be Open


    
    <code>
    Hi,
    I came across your site and the work available there[1]. What you've got
    looks great and from appearances it seems that the material is intended
    to be 'open'[2]. However I couldn't see an explicit statement of this
    fact such as a reference to an open knowledge license[3] so I'm writing
    to find out what the exact situation is, specifically to ask you whether
    the material is being made available under an open knowledge license of
    some kind[3].
    
    Regards,

### Doesn't Appear To Have Thought About It


    
    <code>
    Hi,
    I came across your site and the work available there[1]. What you've got
    looks great and I'd be interested in using it so I wondered whether it
    is 'open knowledge' in the sense that it can be used, reused and
    redistributed freely[2]. If it is intended to be open that's fantastic
    and you might want to consider explicitly licensing your material using
    an open knowledge license[3].Â  If it isn't intended to be open I quite
    understand. In either case I look forward to hearing what the situation
    is.

## Templates for Emails About Open Definition Web Buttons

Word-wrapped at 72 characters for convenience.

### About the Open Knowledge Web Buttons


    
    <code>
    About the Open Knowledge Web Buttons
    
    At the Open Knowledge Foundation (http://www.okfn.org/) we work to
    promote open knowledge wherever we can. As one part of that we have
    developed an 'open knowledge definition':
    [http://www.opendefinition.org/](http://www.opendefinition.org/)
    
    This is very similar to the open source definition but it adapted to the
    case of 'knowledge' -- be that data, content or any other kind of
    information (some more information about the Definition can be found
    below as well as on the website).
    
    As part of the work in developing the Definition we've produced some
    open knowledge/open data web buttons which people can use to indicate
    that the work they are producing is 'open':
    [http://www.opendefinition.org/buttons/](http://www.opendefinition.org/buttons/)
    
    Your project clearly shares exactly the concept of openness set out in
    the Open Knowledge Definition. I was therefore wondering whether you
    would consider placing one of these buttons on your site to indicate
    this (I notice you already have a Creative Commons button on your site).

### Why Have an Open Knowledge Definition


    
    <code>
    Why Have an Open Knowledge Definition
    
    The concept of openness has already started to spread rapidly beyond its
    original roots in academia and software. We already have 'open access'
    journals, open genetics, open geodata, open content etc. As the concept
    spreads so we are seeing a proliferation of licenses and a potential
    blurring of what is open and what is not.
    
    In such circumstances it is important to preserve compatibility, guard
    against dilution of the concept, and provide a common thread to this
    multitude of activities across a variety of disciplines. The definition,
    by providing clear set of criteria for openness, is an essential tool in
    achieving these ends.
