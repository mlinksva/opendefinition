**Open** *bibliographic* data is material that is:

  * "Open" as defined by this site's [Open Definition](/1.0/)-- in essence  freely usable, reusable and redistributable, subject, at most, to the requirements to attribute and sharealike.
  * Data or metadata produced by the bibliographic (library) sector, in particular catalogue (and related) metadata.
