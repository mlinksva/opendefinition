Version 2.0 is the current version of the Open Definition; due to [technical limitations](https://github.com/okfn/opendefinition/issues/63) its canonical text is at <http://opendefinition.org/od/>, or in [git](https://github.com/okfn/opendefinition), /od/index.markdown; this is the file [translators](http://opendefinition.org/participate/#translation) should translate and add to /od/2.0/LC/index.markdown, where LC is a language code.
